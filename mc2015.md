Which of the following calls to mystery will return true?

```
for (int k = str.length(); k > 0; k--)
{
    temp = temp + str.substring(k - 1, k);
}
return temp.equals(str);

k = str.length() = 4
For loop:
temp = str.substring(3, 4); = "n"
temp = str.substring(2, 3); = "o"
temp = str.substring(1, 2); = "o"
temp = str.substring(0, 1); = "n"

```

Answer: noon
